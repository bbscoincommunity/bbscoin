# Synchronization

You wallet should synchronize automatically to the main nodes. If after 15 minutes you do not see a change in synchronization, you may need to change it to use a Remote daemon node by doing the next steps. You may also switch to Remote daemon if you do not want to store a copy of the blockchain on your device. NOTE: The wallet would not let you do anything transaction related until it is fully synchronized.

On your BBSCoin GUI wallet, go to Settings on the menu, and select Preferences.

A windows like the one shown below will appear, please change the \[ Connection ] options to look like the one pictured. "Remote daemon" must be selected, with Host: node.bbscoin.click, and Port: 20204. Then please click on the \[ SAVE ] button. If the wallet doesn't start to synchronize after changing to "Remote daemon", you may need to File, Exit the program, wait like a minute, then restart the program.
