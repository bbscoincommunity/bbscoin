# Send BBSCoin

On this window, you will use the "PAY TO" field to enter the address that was provided to you by the person or business (receiver) whom you will be sending BBS to. Then, enter the correct quantity of BBS you will be sending under the "AMOUNT" field, please be aware of where you place the dot for decimals. You may leave the "FEE" unchanged, unless you would like to donate more to the blockchain miners.&#x20;

Optional: Use the "LABEL" field, if you would like to store the "PAY TO" address in your "CONTACTS". The "PAYMENT ID" doesn't need a value, unless you were explicitly told to add a specific one by the receiver.
